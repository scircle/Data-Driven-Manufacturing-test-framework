# Data-Driven-Manufacturing-test-framework
XML based test framework for hardware 

To test the hardware component, the most intuitional way is to write one test program for each of them. This is easy
to start but not easy to maintain. The code size will bloast dramatically with more component involved.

This is something like procedural programming. In fact, we can create one OOP(object oriented programming) to do the same
thing.

Below is the comparison table.
